## 2. About Quotly
Quotly is a platform focused on, but not limited to, funny, quirky, or crazy quotes from users that they can share with the world.  
Quotly originated as an idea to immortalize statements by quoting them, focusing on slip-ups or bloopers. Quotly is the successor to the original prototype, which was lost.
