## How Cookies Are Used
Cookies and similar technologies, such as local storage, improve your user experience, making it faster and safer.  
Cookies are also essential for operating our services, such as our website, APIs, and integrations.

We only use strictly necessary cookies that are essential for the core functionalities of our platform.

For example, cookies are used to:
- **Keep you logged in.**
- **Provide you with features and functionalities.**
- **Store and utilize your preferences.**
- **Protect you from spam and misuse.**

## What Are Cookies & Local Storage?
**Cookies** are small text files that a web browser saves on your computer (either in the browser folder itself or within program data) while you browse the internet or use a web-enabled app. Examples of cookie usage can be found above.

**Local Storage**  
Data stored in the browser using local storage typically has no expiration date. This means that even if you close the browser tab or application, the data will remain available.

## What Is the Difference Between Cookies & Local Storage?
The direct comparison between cookies and local storage highlights some differences:
- **Storage Size**
  - Local storage provides more space for data storage.
- **Data Transmission**
  - With local storage, data is stored in the browser and accessed directly by the server.
  - Cookies are also stored locally but are sent to the server with every page request.
- **Storage Duration**
  - Cookies have an expiration date or can be deleted at the end of a session.
  - Local storage data remains until manually deleted.
  - However, browsers allow users to clear stored data at any time.

## Why Does Our Platform Use These Technologies?
Cookies and local storage help us and you by providing a smoother experience.  
We primarily focus on using only strictly necessary cookies to minimize any additional effort for you.  
They are used in the following categories:
- **Authentication and Security**
- **Functionality**
- **User Preferences**

### Authentication and Security
Cookies are used to authenticate your account and ensure security by preventing unauthorized access to your account.

### Functionality

## Where Do We Use These Technologies?
We use these technologies across our websites, applications, services, and other platforms where Quotly services are integrated.

## What Are My Options Regarding Data Privacy?
You still have the option to adjust these settings, although doing so might impact your user experience.  
- **Cookie Settings via Web Browser**  
  Most browsers prompt you to allow cookies. Disabling cookies entirely in your browser settings might prevent you from logging in or using certain features.
